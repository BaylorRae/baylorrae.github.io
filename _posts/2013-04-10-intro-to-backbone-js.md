I've been learning Backbone.js and wanted to make a video that might help others
that are in the process of learning it too. You can watch the video here on
Youtube <a href="http://youtu.be/ig-zWy0moAw">http://youtu.be/ig-zWy0moAw</a>

### Why I Created the Video

I found Backbone to be a rather complicated library. Most tutorials explain what
Models, Collections, Views, and Routers are, but they don't seem to explain when
and where to use them.

In my application I didn't want to create a &quot;live&quot; site where any
small change made on the page resulted in updating the database. All I wanted
was better way to structure and write my JS code. As a result, most tutorials
weren't as relevant to me when trying to add various Backbone objects into my
JS.

### How I think Backbone should be learned

What helped me the most is only picking one part of Backbone and learning how
adapt it to how I've always coded. From there, I would see how another part
of Backbone was useful and tied into what I was using and I steadily being
incorporating more and more components.

That's why I made the video. I wanted to make an example of taking a
relatively common problem and step by step implement Backbone where it made
sense.
