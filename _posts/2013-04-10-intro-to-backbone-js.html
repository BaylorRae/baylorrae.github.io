<p>I&#39;ve been learning Backbone.js and wanted to make a video that might help others that are in the process of learning it too. You can watch the video here on Youtube <a href="http://youtu.be/ig-zWy0moAw">http://youtu.be/ig-zWy0moAw</a></p>

</ul>
<h2>Why I Created the Video</h2>
<p>I found Backbone to be a rather complicated library. Most tutorials explain what Models, Collections, Views, and Routers are, but they don&#39;t seem to explain when and where to use them.</p>
<p>In my application I didn&#39;t want to create a &quot;live&quot; site where any small change made on the page resulted in updating the database. All I wanted was better way to structure and write my JS code. As a result, most tutorials weren&#39;t as relevant to me when trying to add various Backbone objects into my JS.</p>
<h2>How I think Backbone should be learned</h2>
<p>What helped me the most is only picking one part of Backbone and learning how adapt it to how I&#39;ve always coded. From there, I would see how another part of Backbone was useful and tied into what I was using and I steadily being incorporating more and more components.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I made the video. I wanted to make an example of taking a relatively common problem and step by step implement Backbone where it made sense.</p>
