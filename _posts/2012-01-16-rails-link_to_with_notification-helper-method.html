<p>In with my last post <a href="http://baylorrae.com/?p=202">on creating a notification badge</a> I showed the HTML and CSS markup. But I forgot that even when the notification count was at zero it still showed the badge.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Because was using a Rails app I wanted to continue using the <code>link_to</code> helper method.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>I created a new helper method called <code>link_to_with_notifications</code> that allowed me to use all the features of <code>link_to</code> and only add the badge if the value was not zero.</p>
