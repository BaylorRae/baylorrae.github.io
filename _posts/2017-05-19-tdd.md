During a recent endeavor of adding code coverage to an existing test framework
I discovered that we had areas in our unit tests that were never run. This lack of
evaluated code was a result of writing the unit tests after the code had been
written instead of having the unit tests drive the application code along with
conditionals in our unit test helpers.

This is something I had not thought of before and I believe should be a good
reminder to always write your unit tests first and have them drive the
direction of your application code.
