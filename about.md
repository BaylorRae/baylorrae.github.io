## Who is Baylor Rae'
I'm an ambitious web developer and designer who loves learning better
programming practices and awesome design techniques. When I'm not fixing a bug
or making a website template then you can probably find me on [YouTube][youtube]
making video tutorials or helping others on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].

### What is this website
I've started `/(b)?logging/` things that I've learned recently. Whether it's a
problem I've encountered from my own projects or something I've assisted with on
Stack Overflow, you can find it in [the archives][archives].

### What do I like to talk about
Most of the articles I've written focus on user experience, application
architecture, and my own projects.
