<h2>Who is Baylor Rae&#39;</h2>
<p>I&#39;m an ambitious web developer and designer who loves learning better programming practices and awesome design techniques. When I&#39;m not fixing a bug or making a website template then you can probably find me on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ScoobyDooobyD00">YouTube</a> making video tutorials or helping others on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/467546/baylor-rae">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
<h2>What is this website</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve started <code>/(b)?logging/</code> things that I&#39;ve learned recently. Whether it&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve encountered from my own projects or something I&#39;ve assisted with on Stack Overflow, you can find it <a href="http://baylorrae.com/archives/">in the archives</a>.</p>
<h2>What do I like to talk about</h2>
<p>Most of the articles I&#39;ve written focus on user experience, application architecture, and my own projects.</p>
