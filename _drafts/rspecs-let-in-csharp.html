<p>I recently started trying to learn TDD with C# while trying to keep as much of my favorite parts from Ruby and RSpec. When I begin this journey I didn't realize how long of a road I had in front of me, but believe it can be <em>almost</em> be done.</p>
<p>The first task towards reaching this goal has beenÂ adding memoization without using test initializers. When defining my tests I prefer to keep all the test data in fields and properties at the top of the class. In other words, as much as possible I want to arrange my objects under test when I define their accessors.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example. Notice that the test data is declared and assigned separately. This is a red flag for two reasons. 1) The data being tested is crammed in a single method that is 2) run and declared regardless of whether or not it is being used.</p>
